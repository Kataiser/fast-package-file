# fast_package_file
Package a directory to a file, with fast file access and compression support

```python
import fast_package_file

# Package a directory into a file
fast_package_file.build('a_directory', 'a_package.file')

# Prepare a package file
data_package = fast_package_file.PackagedDataFile('a_package.file')

# Load a file from the packed directory and save it
with open('any.file', 'wb') as any_file:
  data_package.load(r'path\to\any.file')

# Or just get the raw binary data
from PIL import Image
i = Image.open(io.BytesIO(data_package.load('image.png')))
```

Installation
------------
	pip install fast-package-file

Features
--------

- Is fast because only the data needed is loaded from the package file, total package size is irrelevant
- Obfuscates files from (most) users
- Like a .zip file, but doesn't decompress the entire thing when reading just one file
- Includes the entire directory and subdirectories, not just surface-level files
- Files are compressed with Gzip, but only if compression improves file size (per file) and is enabled (per package file)
- Pretty good error handling when loading package files, just catch fast_package_file.PackageDataError
- Inspired by video game packaging, such as UE4's .pak or GTA V's .rpf formats
